# MIL4Cyto
Released code for the paper ['End-to-end Multiple Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Cytopathology of Urothelial Carcinoma'](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v156/butke21a/butke21a.pdf)
by Joshua Butke, Tatjana Frick, Florian Roghmann, Samir F. El-Mashtoly, Klaus Gerwert and Axel Mosig.

## Overview
This repo contains the Python code of our experiments, however there is no data included. Still, this implementation might serve as a starting point for those interested in applying Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning to problems of cytopathology.

## Citation
Please cite our paper, if this work is of use to you or you use the code in your research:

## Requirements


## Further Reading
I highly recommend to check out the original paper and implementation of Ilse et al for Attention-based MIL, that can be found [here](https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/AttentionDeepMIL), as well as the Li et al. paper ['Deep Instance-Level Hard Negative Mining Model for Histopathology Images'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.09681.pdf). The second one introduced Hard Negative Mining that I adopted. However they never released any code, so I implemented their improvements as best as I could.
